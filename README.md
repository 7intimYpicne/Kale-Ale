# Kale Ale
 
 
Kale originated in the eastern Mediterranean and Anatolia, where it was cultivated for food beginning by 2000 BCE at the latest.[8] Curly-leaved varieties of cabbage already existed along with flat-leaved varieties in Greece in the 4th century BC. These forms, which were referred to by the Romans as Sabellian kale, are considered to be the ancestors of modern kales.

Russian traders introduced Russian kale into Canada and then into the United States in the 19th century.[8] USDA botanist David Fairchild is credited with introducing kale (and many other crops) to Americans,[9][10] having brought it back from Croatia,[10] although Fairchild himself disliked cabbages, including kale.[10] At the time, kale was widely grown in Croatia mostly because it was easy to grow and inexpensive, and could desalinate soil.[10]
 
One may differentiate between kale varieties according to the low, intermediate, or high length of the stem, along with the variety of leaf types. The leaf colours range from light green to green, dark green, violet-green, and violet-brown.
 
Because kale can grow well into winter, one variety of *rape kale* is called "*hungry gap"* after the period in winter in traditional agriculture when little else could be harvested. An extra-tall variety is known as *Jersey kale* or *cow cabbage*.[11] *Kai-lan* or *Chinese kale* is a cultivar often used in Chinese cuisine. In Portugal, the bumpy-leaved kale is mostly called "couve galega" (Galician kale or Portuguese Cabbage).[12]
 
Many varieties of kale and cabbage are grown mainly for ornamental leaves that are brilliant white, red, pink, lavender, blue, or violet in the interior of the rosette. The different types of ornamental kale are peacock kale, coral prince, kamone coral queen, color up kale, and chidori kale.[13] *Ornamental kale* is as edible as any other variety, but potentially not as palatable.[*verification needed*][14] Kale leaves are increasingly used as an ingredient for vegetable bouquets and wedding bouquets.[15]
 
Kale is a source of the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin.[18] As with broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, kale contains glucosinolate compounds, such as glucoraphanin, which contributes to the formation of sulforaphane,[19] a compound under preliminary research for its potential to affect human health beneficially.[20]

Boiling kale decreases the level of glucosinate compounds, whereas steaming, microwaving, or stir frying does not cause significant loss.[21] Kale is high in oxalic acid, the levels of which can be reduced by cooking.[22]
 
In Northern Germany, there is a winter tradition known as "Kohlfahrt" ("kale trip"), where a group of people will go on a hike through the woods during the day before gathering at an inn or private residence where kale is served, usually with bacon and Kohlwurst ("kale sausage").[27] Kale is considered a Northern German staple and comfort food.[28]
 
A traditional Portuguese soup, *caldo verde*, combines pureed potatoes, very finely sliced kale, olive oil and salt.[30] Additional ingredients can include broth and sliced, cooked spicy sausage.
 
In the United Kingdom, the cultivation of kale (and other vegetables) was encouraged during World War II via the Dig for Victory campaign.[34] The vegetable was easy to grow and provided important nutrients missing from a diet because of rationing.[35]
 
The *Kailyard* school of Scottish writers, which included J. M. Barrie (creator of Peter Pan), consisted of authors who wrote about traditional rural Scottish life (*kailyard* = 'kale field').[36] In Cuthbertson's book *Autumn in Kyle and the charm of Cunninghame*, he states that Kilmaurs in East Ayrshire was famous for its kale, which was an important foodstuff. A story is told in which a neighbouring village offered to pay a generous price for some kale seeds, an offer too good to turn down. The locals agreed, but a gentle roasting on a shovel over a coal fire ensured the seeds never germinated.[37]
 
How funny Deb, I just made this last night and ate today! For any skeptics, they really do taste like chips. So delicious! Totally transforms raw kale. Yummy and good for you! I want to try with a variety of spices (garlic, paprika, etc), and I love the idea of Parmesan!
 
I just got rid of all of my kale. I was all set to use it then I found a snail on it. Kind of killed the desire to eat it. Would Rainbow Chard work in this? I think the colors would be really pretty for a party. And its cheaper and easier to find in my neck of the woods than kale (mainly because we grow it).
 
I made these last fall, for the first game of football season. We ate them instead of potato chips, and everyone loved them. Thanks for the reminder, I need to make them again. And the popcorn tip is amazing!
 
i tried my hand at kale chips with dinner on tuesday, but i tossed mine with the juice of about half a lemon and some cayenne to taste. they turned out great! i recommend adding a little lemon juice to your next batch.
 
another delicious use for lacinato kale is to chiffonade it and make a salad with ricotta salata, olive oil, lemon juice, and shallot. it truly is amazingly delicious.
here is a recipe, though usually i use more lemon juice. and you want to make sure the kale is super-thinly cut.
 
The secret for making crispy, not greasy, kale chips is to dry them in a salad spinner after tossing with olive oil and apple cider vinegar. Spread onto sheet pans and sprinkle generously with sea salt. Bake and enjoy your salt and vinegar kale chips. What a way to transform something healthy into something tasty!
 
I make this all the time. And I have to put them in lots of small tupperwares and hide them from myself so that I can keep them as an all-week-long healthy snack rather than I wow-I-just-ate-that-entire-batch-in-10-minutes snack.
 
Hello. I got so excited about this post that I had to de-lurk and tell you how much I love your blog. I love your recipes, the photos and of course the baby photos too! I have been hooked since chocolate pudding pie, in fact I am making one this weekend.
 
Kale chips are pretty amazing, huh? We are part of a CSA and it has made us expand our horizons a lot, so we actually have loads of kale recipes that we like. My most favorite is a kale and white bean dip (it is so creamy and mild, people always assume it is spinach).
 
My favorite way to prepare them is to coat them in really good barbeque sauce along with the olive oil, then toss them on the pan and sea salt/pepper them. Definitely the best way to use up a bunch of kale from the CSA!
 
Ive been seeing kale chips everywhere too and wanted to try some on my own. Bought some kale a couple of weeks ago, but that went into pasta. Now just this week I got another bunch. Hope to make these from them!
 
Deb,
 This is one of my favorite ways to eat kale too! Your right it truly is life changing for people with an aversion to dark bitter greens. I think the first place I was this recipe was a few months ago on the PBS series by Jacques Pepin, Fast Food My Way. I was eager to try it then and have since experimented with other greens, i.e. turnip greens and collard greens and the same recipe has produced wonderful results.
 
I buy three bunches of kale every week at the farmers market for kale chips and can eat a batch by myself in one sitting. Delicious and healthy. I like to sprinkle them with salt, paprika and cayenne.
 
I have never been a fan of greens and definately have never cooked them. I tried these this evening with a little parm. grated over the top. OMG these were fantastic and so-o easy!!! Thanks for sharing:-)
 
Try grilling the kale instead of baking it. It is faster, crispier and more delicious! Just put the the oven on broil, toss the kale with olive oil and kosher salt and then broil in the oven for 5 minutes per side.
 
I bake Kale with a toss of olive oil, salt and pepper along with canneleni beans or chick peas sprinkled on the top of kale. They bake well and make it a more substantial snack. For variation I sometimes add chaat masala or lemon juice or garlic along with salt and pepper. Remember, a little oil goes a long way when baking kale chips.
 
This recipe is great! I love kale, except it pisses me off that it gets stuck in my teeth.
My new favorite way to eat it? Kale and cabbage, sauteed, then mixed with gruyere cheese and topped with butter soaked panko! Now THAT will make you eat your greens!
 
I have made kale chips a few times with the curly kale and was baking them at 350 but I tried your recipe with the more flat kale at 300 and they turned out SO MUCH BETTER! I am so grateful for you posting how to correctly do this. My husband now loves kale chips as much as I do and we make them pretty frequently. I love to put spicy seasoning on them or just plain salt and pepper.
 
I made these tonight and they were fabulous! My salt grinder ran out this morning so I was desperate for a salt alternate and contemplated soy sauce but instead mixed in some anchovy paste with the oil. This really added a nice salty depth of flavor. Umami. Yummy. Thanks for the recipe!
 
My husband and I just made these for the first time because our CSA gave us a huge bunch of kale that we needed to use up. Neither of us are big kale fans, but these were great! I particularly loved the fragile, crunchy texture of the chips.
 
MMM..Before baking I sprinkled a dry miso soup packet on the kale which was just a bit wet from washing, and it was yummy! A little garlic powder (the miso is a bit salty) added to the flavor, but the black sesame seed burned, so I will leave them off next time.
 
The Kale chips look amazing! I have never seen anyone do that before, but I am a horrid snacker in one of the worst ways. I am going to have to try this. Mind if I tip my hat to you on my blog? I plan to use your recipe. :)
 
I made several batches of these last week, with one addition: sweet vinegar. I used a pomegranate and tangerine vinegar for most of the batches, but balsamic worked out really well too. 1 Tablespoon of vinegar along with the oil, then proceed as the recipe says. People were raving about how good they were.
